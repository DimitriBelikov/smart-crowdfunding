  "description": "We have proposed a Smart Crowdfunding application based on Blockchain technology i.e. a decentralized application that replaces a middle-man (like a Bank or a human) with a smart block of code ,or so we call it a smart contract, that handles all the functioning related to the donations.  With this Project and the help of blockchain smart-contracts, donors would be informed about the payments to be processed by the Fundraiser through request money forms. A smart contract helps to block the funds within the Blockchain until the campaign contributors agrees to release them to the organizing entity.
